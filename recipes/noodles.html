    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For me, there's a certain ritualism to making instant noodles: a quiet, tragic ceremony performed by one who once believed they'd "learn full stack in 30 days" and now find themselves staring into a half-clean mug, wondering if life is supposed to feel this... <em>textured.</em></p>
    <p>The thing about instant noodles is that they beautifully reflect an uncomfortably comforting sort of pretense. They are not quite food, and certainly not nourishment, yet they pretend to be and we pretend with them. Much like the self-taught "developer" who knows HTML, CSS, and exactly two Tailwind classes, and has somehow rebranded this shaky foundation as "I can code." The packaging itself is an illusion. A promise of warmth, comfort, flavour, <em>food</em> &mdash; much like the promises made by tutorial thumbnails saying things like "Build a SaaS in 12 minutes!" You know the truth. You've always known. But you click the video anyway, because hope is a stubborn, stupid little animal.</p>
    <p>As the steam rises, you experience a familiar sensation: "This counts as making dinner." You tell yourself this as you peel open the seasoning packet, that shimmering pouch of sodium dust found in the deepest basement subfloor of the food pyramid. You sprinkle it in while being vaguely aware that something is not right about all this, but you're too tired to care. The noodles soften, like your ambitions around the age of 23. You give them a half-hearted stir with the same energy you bring to most everything else in life. Sometimes, in a fleeting moment of self-delusion, you add an egg. Not because you know anything about cooking or human nutrition, but because you crave the illusion of competence. And then there's the option to add condiments. A squirt of sriracha will make you believe the broth has depth. A knob of butter will make you think it is decadent. A sad torn leaf of coriander pretends at gourmet. You know the truth behind all of this. You know the powdered seasoning has zero intention of feeding you properly. You know you can't cook. But it doesn't matter. Eggs are the UX polish of noodles. It signals investment, it looks like care, and it makes the steam coming off of your now photo-worthy dish rise in a way that suggests culinary art direction.</p>
    <p>When it's done, you pour everything into a bowl that you didn't wash properly, and for a brief moment, as you sit down at your desk littered with sticky notes that say things like "learn git" and "clean room?", you somehow feel something like comfort. Perhaps even pride. This is the same sensation you get when you write a silly recipe page in HTML and convince yourself the world has been improved. You didn't make an app, true, but <em>you made a thing.</em> You added special characters. You used VS Code. You committed.</p>
    <p>This is your meal.</p>
    <p>Your creation.</p>
    <p>It tastes almost like a homecooked meal, if you close your eyes and forget what food is supposed to be.</p>
    <p>And even though you know it provides zero nutritional value, you slurp it up anyway, because it resembles effort, and sometimes that's enough.</p>
    <p>If you're still reading this, congratulations: you're capable of sustained attention.</p>
