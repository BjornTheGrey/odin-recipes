    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is something special about a slice of pizza found lurking in the back of the fridge at 2 a.m. It is a reliquary of decisions past: the optimistic choice to add something greasy and delicious to a night that promised fun but delivered regret, the heroic refusal to throw it away when it cooled, the quiet acceptance that ambition (like cheese) sometimes ossifies into a cold, brittle mess.</p>
    <p>When you extract that triangular relic from the cold dark of the fridge, you hold more than food. You hold evidence. Evidence that you once had plans, that you once believed in your late-night optimisms, that the future contained at least one warm and tasty possibility. And now that future is a little colder, but the pizza remains. A monument to deferred expectations.</p>
    <p>Reheating it is a philosophical choice. Cold pizza tastes like a meeting that could have been an email. It tastes like the first draft of a brilliant idea you never finished. It tastes like the debug session that lasted until dawn and discovered, instead of solutions, the existential emptiness that lives behind everything you do. It tastes like <em>reality</em>. It is at once triumphant and tragic, an edible liminal space between what you promised yourself and what actually happened. Some people reheat their regrets and call it restoration. Others eat straight from the box with the practiced nonchalance of someone who has spent years optimising for minimal effort. Both are valid choices. There is virtue here, in whichever method you choose, as long as the choice comes from a place of authenticity and not from pretense. Reality remains unltimately unchanged by your approach.</p>
    <p>So this is not a recipe so much as a liturgy. It is a set of instructions for how to honour your past self without pretending you didn't make poor choices. It's a way to acknowledge that the life you intended to lead and the one you've stumbled into are, for now, negotiated over cheese that has settled into the geometry of disappointment.</p>
    <p>If you're still reading, that means you care, and I appreciate that.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Leftover slices of pizza (at least one), ideally refridgerated overnight or for an indeterminate amount of time</li>
            <li>A muted sense of regret (optional, but recommended for full effect)</li>
            <li>1 microwave or oven (optional, reheating is a character choice)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Choose one of the preparation methods below, then continue to the final step.</p>
    <h3>Method A: The Cold Slice (Low-Effort Purist)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove pizza from fridge.</li>
            <li>Inspect it like a hungover archeologist finding a relic with their name on it, assess its edibility.</li>
            <li>Eat directly, preferably in dim lighting.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Method B: Microwaved (Compromise)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove pizza from fridge and place on microwave safe plate.</li>
            <li>Heat for 15-30 seconds. Check. Repeat until too hot to eat.</li>
            <li>Don't bother waiting for it to cool, just <em>hashhshafashshhaasha</em>.</li>
        </ol>    
    <h3>Method C: Re-Oven (Rare Commitment)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190&deg;C / 375&deg;F or whatever feels right.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza from fridge and place on baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake for 5-10 minutes, until cheese softens and crust regains a fragile sense of pride.</li>
        </ol>
     <h3>The Final Step (regardless of method)</h3>
        <p>Stand over the sink, take a bite, and consider whether your life choices are as salvageable as this dish. If not, consider pairing with a <a href="./smoko.html">coffee and a smoke</a>.</p>
