    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>People say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Personally, I think that's optimistic. Most mornings, the only thing I consume is the crushing weight of my own expectations and a cold cup of coffee that I forgot to finish the night before while debugging something that really should have worked the first time.</p>

    <p>You know, it's funny how certain flavours become tangled up with the moments that shape us. When I think of a classic <em>Coffee and a Smoke</em>, I'm trasported back to early winter mornings in my grandmother's kitchen, not because she ever actually made this recipe, but because the idea of a coffee and a smoke reminds me of her. Or maybe it was my uncle. Or perhaps it was just that one neighbour everyone avoided. Memory is a strange, misty thing, much like the aroma rising from this dish.</p>

    <p>Growing up, mornings were sacred. Not because of any spiritual rituals, but becasue everyone in the house moved slowly and dramatically, like actors performing exhaustion rather than experiencing it. My grandfather would sit at the head of the table, clutching his chipped mug (the one with a faded picture of a fish on it) and take a long, theatrical sip of his coffee. He'd then step outside to have a smoke, because <em>"that's where ideas come from,"</em> he'd say, gesturing vaguely toward the horizon like a man who had seen too much and understood too little.</p>

    <p>I remember standing at the doorway, watching the steam from his coffee mingle with the smoke from his cigarette, curling together like two old friends who've silently agreed to share the burden of existence. There was something beautiful in that moment, something that spoke to a deep, primal part of of the human soul, or so I believed. In retrospect, it was probably just the second-hand nicotine.</p>

    <p>Still, those quiet moments left an impression. The scent of roasted coffee beans mingled with cold air and pungent tobacco became, in my mind, the fragrance of contemplation. A smell that meant something mattered, even if no one could quite articulate what.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to many years later, long after the chipped fish mug had disappeared and the house had been repainted a colour more bleak than my general outlook on life, I found myself craving that same familiar combination. That feeling. That stillness. That melancholic morning poetry that exists only when the world is quiet and you're convinced you could, theoretically, change your life if you tried hard enough.</p>

    <p>And so, this recipe was reborn. A homage to nostalgia, to rituals that no longer exist, to memories you may or may not have had. It's simple, comforting, and carries with it a certain whisper &mdash; like an old friend tapping you on the shoulder to remind you that, somehow, you've survived.</p>

    <p>If you're still reading this, I admire your resilience. Either you're commited, or you're procrastinating something important. Possibly both.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I suppose you want the recipe now...</p>
